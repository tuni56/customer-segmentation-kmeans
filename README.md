# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project uses **unsupervised learning** to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. Using the **K-Means algorithm**, we identify patterns in customer age, annual income, and spending score to support strategic business decisions.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Group customers into distinct segments for targeted marketing.
- **Dataset:** Mall customers dataset (200 entries, 5 features).
- **Techniques used:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature scaling
  - Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
  - K-Means clustering
  - Cluster visualization and interpretation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## 📌 Key Results
Found optimal number of clusters with the Elbow Method

Segmented customers into behavior-driven groups

Gained insights to drive business decisions (e.g. targeted campaigns, promotions)

## 💡 Future Improvements
Add Genre (Gender) as a categorical feature with encoding

Test other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

Deploy interactive dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit
